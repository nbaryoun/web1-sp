title: Senior SZN Pt. 2

So, ever since I wrote that, I've been thinking. I believe the reason it hasn't hit me that I'm graduating is that part of me doesn't want to believe it. 

My college career has been an eye-opener to say the least. I started out my freshman year at UMD, just 20mins away from the capital. Let's just say, I did not do well. At all. Come end of my freshman year, I'd been kicked out on account of 2 semesters in a row of academic probation.

From then on, it was always a battle up. A battle to prove that I can succeed. To my family, my friends, and to myself. Here I am. Spring 2018, graduating on time with a computer science degree.

I need to learn to sit back and enjoy this.

Yours truly,
Nora B.
