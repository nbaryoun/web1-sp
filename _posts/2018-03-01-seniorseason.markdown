title: Senior SZN

Yup, you guessed it. I'm a senior. Last semester. What an exciting time. Or at least that's what I'm hearing from everyone. For me, it hasn't really sunk in yet. I feel like I'm out here faking the excitment with my classmates. It hasn't hit me that I'll be starting real life soon.

I don't know when it'll hit, but I can't wait for that feeling of acomplishment. Of excitment. Of relief.
