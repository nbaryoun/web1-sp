title: My Personal Site
---

So I have this personal site online - nxbaryoun.com . I HATE it. It has all my work on it, so I show it to employers, but I hate the design. I keep telling myself I'm going to fix it but everytime I sit to do it, I don't even know where to begin. I think this might be a tear down situation. If you have any suggesions, feel free to hit me up. I'll take all the critism it takes.
