title: what now?
---

Today was my last day of undergrade. It's finally hit me. I didn't think it'd take this long to register in my brain, but it has. No more classes. For the first time in my life, I am about to NOT have school.

I'm excited to start my adult life. I'm in the process of a few interviews, so we'll see how this goes. One thing I refuse to do is mindlessly clock in and clock out. I refuse to have my light and energy sucked away by corprate America. I'm in no rush. Whatever I end up doing, I want to enjoy it. I won't settle. That's my promise to myself. *settles one day later*.
