title: The Urban Bubble
---

I've been thinking a lot recently, a lot of what I think is "good design" is that of urban culture. Whether it be the class that Vogue prides itself on, or the street wear that artists seem to love these days, it's all urban. This has been part of the reasons all my "where I wanna move when I'm done with school" are cities. Is this a problem? Are we living in a bubble?

I feel like the suburban/rural needs have been neglected, because there seems to be this stigma that they don't understand art or fashion or design. I know for a fact that can't be true. They've got to be rich in their own culture. Maybe one day I'll find out what that is - but probably not stay for too long, the big city awaits.

Best,
Nora
