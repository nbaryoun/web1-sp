title: A Picture is Worth..
---

I've already talked about my travel obsession, but what makes it even better is the photography. I love photography, and am not a terrible picture taker. I enjoy landscapes and architecture. One of my favorite things in the world is to be able to loose myself in a new place with a camera.

Last summer, I spent a week in Paris with my family and a camera. The city comes to life in a different way with photos. The building designs show themselves in a way you don't notice with your bear eye. You focus on the details, the man scolding the child for trying to steal from his store, the friends hudled around a cloth on the floor where a man is selling suvineers, the intimate moment between to lovers leaning on the side of a building. The colors of the world come alive in a different way.
