title: My Vogue Dream
---

In the past four years, I've developed a dream of working at Vogue. I've always believed that they don't put the care and effort they do in the rest of their brands, to their website. It's boring and cluttered at the same time - how is that possible.

I've been writing them angry emails about once a year, and attaching my resume at the end. Who knows, maybe one day it'll work.

Yours truly,
NXB.
