First of all, I know NXB's World is corny. I couldn't think of anything else. I apologize. 

Anyways, thanks for deciding to take a look at this thang. Whether your my professor (yes-I'm doing this for a class), or my friends (thanks for the support homies) or just a random on looker (there's literally no way you exist since I'm never showing anyone this), welcome. Browse around, this is kinda what I'm into these days. Hope you enjoy.

P.S. I apologize in advance for my unexceptably excessive amount of comma use, I don't know why I do it and I don't think I can stop.

yours truly,
nxbaryoun.
