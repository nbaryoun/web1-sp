title: Material Design

Ever since we watched the movie in class about material design, I can't stop thinking about it. I think about it in everything that I do. Everything I use and touch, I wonder why it was made the way it was. What an interesting concept. That every little bend has a purpose.

I feel like sometimes, that's what I missing when it comes to designing sites on my own. Everything should have a purpose, rather than designing just because it looks good. Or maybe there's a healthy relationship between the two, a little bit of both. Beats me.
