title: Ripped Magazines?
---

About a year ago, I subscribed to a bunch of cool magazines. When I get time, I'll look through all of them and rip out pictures or pages that I like. I'll organize them into reason for liking (layout, color scheme, font, etc.) and I'll put them on my shelf in a folder. I've never looked back at them. I don't know why I do it. But it's there.
