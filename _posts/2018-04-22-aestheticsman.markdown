title: Aesthetics?
---

These days, everything is an aesthetic. Hating on aesthetics IS an aesthetic. 
A cactus on a wooden desk - aesthetic.
Someone who only has apple products - aesthetic.
Wearing a lot of rings - aesthetic.
Windows - aesthetic.

Do I hate this? Not really. Do I think sometimes people use the word aesthetic incorrectly? Yea probably.

Everyone is an artist, everyone is a designer, everyone has their own aesthetic.

Your truly,
Aesthetic.
