title: So Long
---

I've done it. Finished with college. These are literally the last words I'm writing that will be submitted as college work. Very dramatic. A little bit surreal.

What I've learned this semester from this class, as well as just in general, I'll take with me forever. I don't know if this was the point of this blog assignment, but it's been a nice place to write all my thoughts down, kind of like a diary. I might even continue it after this is over.

I'd just like to thank my professor, you're really considerate and a genuinely nice guy. Don't lose that!

And to the rest of my non-existant audience, thanks for sticking around.

Yours truly,
Nora Baryoun.
