title: The Best Book.
---

For my Graphic Design class, we were required to get this book called "HTML & CSS" by Jon Duckett. To my excitment, I already had the book. I also had its sister book "JavaScript & JQuery". Let me just say, I LOVE THESE BOOKS. They break everything down. So easy to understand. Even easier to try it out for yourself and see. And to come full circle here, it actaully is all about the "UI" of the book. I love them.

Granted, they are for beginers, so they're meant to be easy.......but still.
