title: "Mahogany Sessions"

Mahogany Sessions is an organization that is dedicated to finding very lowkey, but talented artists to record a song live. Mahogany finds locations that match the aesthetic of the artist, and with their incredible camera crew, record a beautiful rendition of the a song of the artist's choice. Often times, they also can accompany the musician with musicians of their own.

I personally love watching Mahogany sessions. The quality of sound and ambiance the organization is able to create is outstnding. With just one video, I find myself instantely hooked. Hours and hours can pass by as I move from video to video. But even better than that - sometimes I'll see a video of a particular artist and get hooked. A lot of my favorite musicians I've discovered off of their Mahongany Sessions video.

Now, aside from the music, the videos are a peice of art on their own. They're shot in one take, and capture the essence of the artist's "vibe" perfectly. They pan from the expressions on the artist's face, to the scenic background, to the other background musicians (if there are any) and back to the main attraction. You can really tell they put time and effort into every single video - you won't find this kind of consistant quality anywhere else. 

If you couldn't tell, I'm veryyy passionate about them. And no, they didn't pay me any money for this. Thanks for tuning in folks.

Yours truly,
