title: See the World
---

In a prefect world where money didn't exist, I'd be one of two things: an interior designer, or a travelor. I ache to see the world, to be immersed in other cultures. I've been lucky enough to see a lot of the world at a young age. At the age of 21, I've already been to 5 of the world's 7 continents. But that's just not enough. I want to see it all.

Best,
A Dreamer.
